ShortStack is what I use to make all my games in Lens Studio and now I'm giving my most powerful asset to you\n\nShortStack combines behaviors, interaction, transformations, physics, animation, tweening, sound, renderering, data, and more into one fast simple plain English language\n\n'ShortStacks' are little state machines with one incredible breakthrough benefit - they can be nested into each other enabling you to easily sync and update the state of a prefab or even an entire scene\n\nStates automatically close themselves out making it easy to jump from Menu to Game, or Idle to Attack, just focus on functionality not managing it\n\nShortStack is also very efficient and brings your project down to literally one UpdateEvent loop, which is also pauseable/playable!\n\nYou can also create your own functionality ('Shortcuts') which plug right into ShortStack enabling you to shape it to your own use case\n\nIncluded are many examples of how to take advantage of ShortStack"}
